                            determines the advertising resources of this site, enabling it to provide its services,
                            which are often supplied free of charge to users. You doubtless prefer to see offers and

                            all. Similarly, both MAKE UP FOR EVER and advertisers want their offers and advertising to
                            be shown to Internet users that are likely to be interested in them. </p>
